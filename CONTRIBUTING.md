## How to Contribute

Fork then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/react-spinners.git

Create a new branch:

    git checkout -b awesome-feature

Install the necessary dependencies (you can use `npm` or `yarn`):

    npm install

If you want to make changes to the demo page, you can edit the files in `examples` and `docs` folder.

To see the changes to the loaders or the demo site, you can use `webpack` to update the bundle file.

    npm run watch

And open `./docs/index.html` in your favorite browser.

After all the changes are made, make sure nothing changed in the demo site by running

    npm run build:demo

And commit the file changes in the docs folder.

Then commit your changes:

    git add -A;
    git commit -m 'Awesome new feature';

Make sure to run the necessary tests and lints and fix any errors:

    npm run lint;
    npm run test:jest;

Push up to Github:

    git push origin awesome-feature;
